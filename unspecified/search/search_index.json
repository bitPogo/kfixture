You can either define a Generator for an entire Type (unqualified) or you can specialize it with an Qualifier. Both cases will make it available to the existing Extension Functions. In order to hook them in you can do the following:</p> <pre><code>import tech.antibytes.kfixture.PublicApi.Generator\nimport tech.antibytes.kfixture.PublicApi.GeneratorFactory\n\nclass MySpec {\n    class MyAwesomeTypeGenerator(\n        private val random: Random\n    ): Generator&lt;MyAwesomeType&gt; {\n        override fun generate(): MyAwesomeType {\n            ...\n        }\n\n        companion object : GeneratorFactory&lt;MyAwesomeType&gt; {\n            override fun getInstance(random: Random): Generator&lt;MyAwesomeType&gt; = MyAwesomeTypeGenerator(random)\n        }\n    }\n\n    class StringAlphaGenerator(\n        private val random: Random\n    ) : Generator&lt;String&gt; {\n        override fun generate(): String {\n            val length = random.nextInt(1, 10)\n            val chars = ByteArray(length)\n\n            for (idx in 0 until length) {\n                val char = random.nextInt(65, 91)\n                chars[idx] = if (random.nextBoolean()) {\n                    (char + 32).toByte()\n                } else {\n                    char.toByte()\n                }\n            }\n\n            return chars.decodeToString()\n        }\n\n        companion object : GeneratorFactory&lt;String&gt; {\n            override fun getInstance(random: Random): Generator&lt;String&gt; = StringAlphaGenerator(random)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private val fixture = kotlinFixture {\n        // unqualified\n        addGenerator(\n            clazz = MyAwesomeType::class,\n            factory = MyAwesomeTypeGenerator\n        )\n        // qualified\n        addGenerator(\n            clazz = String::class,\n            factory = StringAlphaGenerator,\n            qualifier = qualifiedBy(\"special\"),\n        )\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun myAwesomeTest() {\n        val value: String = fixture.fixture(\n            qualifier = qualifiedBy(\"special\")\n        )\n        val awesomeValue: MyAwesomeType = fixture.fixture()\n        ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Unlike with Extension Functions you will not have the Fixture scope, but you can define dependencies.
