## About The Project
Tired of writing potato or 42 for your test values? - KFixture is a (limited) extendable generator test value generator for Kotlin Multiplatform which can help you out there.
The project is heavily influenced by [appmattus kotlinfixture](https://github.com/appmattus/kotlinfixture) and was started to ease a bit testing on KMP.
If you want to know more take a look into the [Documentation](https://bitpogo.github.io/kfixture/).
